# Prime Number Checker Application
A small application that will take a user's input and check to see if it is a prime number.

## Features
- The application has these features:
  - Prime Number Checking
  - Validation
  - Repeat until quit
  - Progress display - Optional

## Progress Display
Beginning at `line 68` to `line 80`, user's should be able to see a piece of code commented out.
Removing the multi-line comments (`/**` & `**/`) and you should see a percentage in the command window which will notify you of the app's progress.
As the comment says, using this progress percentage will significantly slow down the speed of the application.

## Additional Info
You can mess around with some of the data types for certain variables such as `long` for the `userPrimeNumberConv`and `Convert.ToInt64` to your liking.

The larger the number you enter the longer the program will take to check if it is a prime number or not.

Not all Exceptions have been covered but most of the ones that I could run into will provide an appropriate response.
